# FirNOW üî•
üëã Welcome to our project repository! This project is aimed at revolutionizing public grievance management, specifically focusing on FIR (First Information Report) filing in India, using blockchain technology to enhance transparency, security, and efficiency.

## Problem Statement üìì
The current crime reporting systems in India suffer from inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and privacy concerns. Our solution addresses these limitations by **integrating blockchain technology** to streamline the FIR process.

## Key Features üîç
**1. Blockchain Integration:**  Utilizes **_Polygon blockchain_** to decentralize FIR filings. Ensures immutability of records, preventing tampering or data corruption. Supports data privacy through cryptographic techniques.

**2. Smart Contracts & Decentralized Governance:**  Smart contracts automate and ensure accountability in FIR filing processes. Implements a **_decentralized system_** to reduce fraud and increase transparency in the public grievance system.

**3. Enhanced Security:** Data is encrypted and stored securely using **_IPFS and Filecoin_**. Ensures that FIR filings are securely stored and can be retrieved without fear of data manipulation.

**4. FIR Lodging Process:** Victims can lodge FIRs online, with added security features like camera and microphone access to verify authenticity. Decentralized transactions using Bitcoin for filing fees.

## System Design üõ†Ô∏è
  1. Built using React.js for the frontend, with user-friendly dashboards for both victims and police stations.

  2. Backend powered by FastAPI, with Redis for caching and PostgreSQL for data storage.
  
  3. Uses Nginx as a reverse proxy for secure and efficient handling of API requests.
  
  4. Authentication handled via OAuth2 and JWTs for secure sessions.

## Software Engineering Methodology üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
**1. Agile Methodology:**   Focus on user-centric design and iterative development with continuous feedback from stakeholders.

**2. Cross-Functional Teams:**  Involving experts in blockchain integration, frontend, backend, and security to ensure holistic system development.
